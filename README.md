# Sponsors

Repository used to store my sponsors SVG file that is reference in my other repositories.

## Usage

1. Create a `BACKERS.md` file in the root of the repository
2. Add the following lines to the `BACKERS.md` file

```md
<h1 align="center">Sponsors & Backers</h1>

The development of this project is made possible thanks to the support of these awesome sponsors & backers.
